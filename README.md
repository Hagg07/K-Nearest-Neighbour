# K-Nearest-Neighbour
Assignment=1 for implementing the K Nearest Neighbor from the UMich EECS 498-007 / 598-005 Course on Deep Learning for Computer Vision 

Please check knn.py for code implemented by me on the assignment and knn.ipynb for executing it through colab. I implemented the code for the two loops and one loops myself and checked the internet for the solution to the no loops distance calculation on the internet because there was a size and reshaping error in the tensor with the code i wrote.
